          The Aviator is a popular money entertainment produced by Spribe on
          numerous well-known websites. You may win big money with a coefficient
          of up to x100. In the game, players get the most enjoyment and have
          the opportunity to make a lot of money in little time. In the game,
          Aviator players can be risky pilots who must reach maximum altitude in
          order to achieve a successful win. The coefficient is multiplied by
          the amount invested to determine how much money is earned. To withdraw
          your funds, you must quit the flight in time.
